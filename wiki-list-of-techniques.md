# List of judo techniques
_From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia_

This is a list of judo techniques. They are categorized into throwing techniques (nage-waza), grappling techniques (katame-waza), body-striking techniques (atemi-waza), blocks and parries (uke-waza), receiving/breakfall techniques (ukemi), and resuscitation techniques (kappo).

The above categorization of techniques is orthogonal to the categorization of domains of combat, which include tachi-waza (立技; standing) and ne-waza (寝技; ground). Some techniques can be used only in one of these domains, and some can be used in both.[1] In practice, ne-waza is often used as a synonym of katame-waza (固技; grappling techniques),[2] or some of its subcategories, most often osaekomi-waza (抑込技; holding techniques) and possibly also kansetsu-waza (関節技; joint techniques).[3]

Gokyo-no-waza (五教の技; Five sets of techniques) is yet another subcategorization of nage-waza into 5 main groups, as well as groups of preserved techniques (habukareta-waza) and new techniques (shinmeisho-no-waza). This grouping has been made for pedagogical purposes ("Learning the throws in order is the key to mastery."[4]).
